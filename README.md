CSS has lots of magical corners that can save you tremendous time.  Come find them! In this course, web designer and developer Morten Rand-Hendriksen shows you how to address specific challenges with a bite-sized approach that lets you find what you need quickly. Morten covers topics such as containers, typography, layout, and more. In each video, he teaches a technique that you can apply in your web styling, something concise and quick that can make your complicated projects simpler.

## Instructions
This repository has folders for each movie named for the chapter and movie number, so chapter 3, movie 2 has the corresponding folder 03_02. If the code is changed during the movie, you'll find two folders for that movie, one titled XX_XXb for "beginning" and another titled XX_XXe for "end". To follow along, use the b folder. The e folder is there for comparison.

## Installing
The exercise files are stand-alone examples in HTML and CSS. You do not need any additional software to run them, and you are free to copy the code and use it in your own projects.
