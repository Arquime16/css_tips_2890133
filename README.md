# CSS Tips
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `CSS Tips`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].


_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has folders for each movie named for the chapter and movie number, so chapter 3, movie 2 has the corresponding folder 03_02. If the code is changed during the movie, you'll find two folders for that movie, one titled XX_XXb for "beginning" and another titled XX_XXe for "end". To follow along, use the b folder. The e folder is there for comparison.

## Installing
The exercise files are stand-alone examples in HTML and CSS. You do not need any additional software to run them, and you are free to copy the code and use it in your own projects.
